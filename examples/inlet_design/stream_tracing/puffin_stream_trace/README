Puffin test case: truncated Busemann diffuser
=============================================
Rowan Gollan, 2022-02-08

This directory contains inputs to run a Puffin calculation that
simulates the supersonic flow in a truncated Busemann diffuser.
A truncated Busemann diffuser is one in which an ideal Busemann
contour is truncated at a finite lip angle.
This shortens the length of the diffuser, often greatly,
but introduces a shock at the diffuser entrance.

To exercise the test, launch the `run-bd.sh` script.
